clustering_api
==============

JSON API for CSCI 497E Program 1.

Calls up the assignment backend in a thread, caches the results, and returns points and per-round clustering data to the web client.

Parses README.txt in prog1_data to find input file specifications.

Will require modifications if you need to use it with a non-Java backend or are not me.
